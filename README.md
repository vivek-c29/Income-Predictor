# Income-Predictor

In this project, I focused on predicting income levels using machine learning techniques. I began by cleaning and preprocessing a dataset containing various demographic features, utilizing libraries such as Pandas, NumPy,Matplot lib and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization. After identifying feature importance, I trained three classification models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. Finally, I deployed the trained models on a local host using Streamlit, enabling interactive user access to the predictions.
